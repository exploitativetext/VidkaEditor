# VidkaEditor
Non-linear video editor, better than sony vegas and final cut pro...
It relies on AviSynth to generate the final video, however the editor
provides an easy-to-use interface for video editing. Enjoy!

You will need to have the following commands available in your PATH:

 - [ffmpeg/ffprobe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
 - [mencoder/mplayer](http://mplayerwin.sourceforge.net/downloads.html)
 - [avisynth 2.6](http://avs-plus.net/) or above
